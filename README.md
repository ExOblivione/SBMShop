# SBMShop
SBM POC Webshop

Student Book Market today consists of a strong team of two: a concept developer and a software developer. We were creating a Web Application for students attending higher education, that is similar to dba.dk only with educational books. Removing shipping costs by providing free drop point (sellers drop down the book there, and buyer can pick it up when he wants) locations near all schools in Denmark. Students will get free or cheaper food and beverages when they use the drop point locations. The project shown here is just a proof of concept which you can use to build up your own webshop with ASP .NET C#, that is hosted as a Microsoft Azure App Service.
